Randomizer
----------

This program takes an input file, shuffles the line order randomly, and outputs the reordered file into a new file.

This shuffle program does not store the file contents in memory. Instead, it only stores the file pointers corresponding to the start of each line. Thus, making it feasible to shuffle large text files on memory constrained systems.

Compiling:

make clean && make

Compiling Debug version:

The debug version simply outputs some additional information to the console.

make clean && make debug

Running the program:

./randomizer -f <file name> -o <output file name> [-i <iterations>]

The iterations represents the number of times to randomize the file.
